# WGS2IBI: A Cloud-Based Modular Workflow for Streamlined Individualized Bayesian WGS Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository provides the CWL code, Docker containers, and scripts for **WGS2IBI** â€” a **cloud-based, modular workflow** that streamlines **Individualized Bayesian Inference (IBI)** for **whole genome sequencing (WGS)** data analysis.  

Optimized for scalability, reproducibility, and cost-efficiency, WGS2IBI enables both population-level and individual-level genomic discovery.  
The workflow has been tested on large datasets, such as the **TOPMed Freeze 8 and Freeze 9 cohorts**.

## Key Features  
- **Scalability**: Supports large cohorts (thousands of participants, >100M variants).  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Preprocessing and IBI analysis can be completed for under **$25 per cohort** on AWS.  
- **Cloud Readiness**: Deployable on cloud platforms (AWS, Seven Bridges) or local HPC clusters.  
- **Reproducibility**: Fully containerized with Docker and standardized using CWL.  
- **Memory Optimization**: Uses numpy arrays and dynamic batching to minimize RAM usage.  
- **Population and Individual Analysis**: Integrates GWAS (Fisher test, GDSearch) and IBI for comprehensive insights.

## Workflow Components
- **Preprocessing Tool**:  
  `cwl/preprocessing.cwl` â€” VCF2SNP tool Processes raw WGS VCF files using BCFtools, PLINK, and Numpy.
- **Population-Level Analysis Tools**:  
  `cwl/population_analysis_fisher.cwl` â€” Conducts Fisher's exact test for GWAS.  
  `cwl/population_analysis_gdsearch.cwl` â€” Conducts GDSearch for GWAS.
- **Top-k Variant Pool Extraction Scripts**:  
  `scripts/initial_analysis.py` â€” Performs initial ranking analysis and generates the top-k variants pool.  
  `scripts/Confirm_topk_pool.py` â€” Confirms and manages selection of top-k variants for downstream analysis.
- **Individual-Level Analysis Tool (IBI)**:  
  `cwl/individual_analysis_ibi.cwl` â€” Performs Individualized Bayesian Inference (IBI) on the selected top-k variant pool.

---

## Performance Summary
- Reduced preprocessing time and costs by dynamically optimizing cloud resources.
- Achieved preprocessing costs of **$20.83** and individual-level analysis costs of **under $5** for cohorts like JHS (2,777 samples).
- Demonstrated scalability across datasets such as JHS, WHI, MESA, FHS, and GENOA.

## Access Options

### 1. GitHub Repository (Current Page)
The full workflow source code, CWL files, and example scripts are provided here for researchers who wish to set up the workflow manually.  
See the **Getting Started** section below for setup instructions.

### 2. Public Project on Seven Bridges (Recommended for Testing)
A public project hosting **WGS2IBI** is available on the Seven Bridges platform.  
This provides the easiest way to run the workflow **without any installation**.  

**Access the public project here:**  
[https://sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/projects/f8e1d6a6-6f2e-4fa7-aaa3-d63d663ef9e5/WGS2IBI](https://sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/projects/f8e1d6a6-6f2e-4fa7-aaa3-d63d663ef9e5/WGS2IBI)  
*(Example URL â€” replace with your actual project link if different.)*

**Create a free Seven Bridges account here:**  
[https://accounts.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/auth/login](https://accounts.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/auth/login)


**Advantages:**
- Fully set up and ready to use â€” no need to install CWL runners, Docker, or manage AWS instances.
- After creating a Seven Bridges account, users can **anonymously copy and test** the public WGS2IBI project without needing to contact the authors.
- Users can **review previously submitted jobs**, including job inputs, parameters, outputs, and runtime settings â€” making it easy to learn how the workflow operates.
- A **sample dataset** from the **1000 Genomes Project benchmark data** is included in the public project for immediate testing.
- Free trial credits available: Simply email **support@sevenbridges.com** with the subject "Request for Trial Access to WGS2IBI Project."

## Sample Data

To facilitate testing and exploration of the WGS2IBI workflow, a **sample dataset** derived from the **1000 Genomes Project benchmark data** is provided.

- The sample dataset includes a subset of variants.
- It is designed for **benchmarking**, **demonstration**, and **exploration** of the tools' full capabilities without needing controlled-access data.
- Available in both:
  - The public project on Seven Bridges (pre-loaded and ready to use)
  - The `/data` directory in this GitHub repository

Researchers can **run the entire WGS2IBI workflow end-to-end** using this sample dataset to understand the preprocessing, population analysis, top-k variant extraction, and individualized Bayesian inference steps.

> **Compatibility Note:**  
> The WGS2IBI workflow is **fully compatible** with large-scale datasets from **TOPMed Freeze 8 and later cohorts**, including **FHS**, **JHS**, **MESA**, **GENOA**, and **WHI**.  
> These cohorts can be accessed directly the Seven Bridges BioData Catalyst platform, eliminating the need to manually download and upload massive genomic files.

> **Access Requirements:**  
> Please note that **TOPMed datasets are controlled access** and require appropriate authorization (e.g., dbGaP approval).  
> Therefore, to enable immediate testing without access restrictions, the 1000 Genomes sample data is provided.
